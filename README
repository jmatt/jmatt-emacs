My emacs configuration for aquamacs / clojure / ruby / python on mac osx 10.6

Also works with brew installed emacs 24.1.

Works in combination with my fork of emacs-starter-kit

Thanks to everyone who created awesome open source projects for emacs!

TODOs: Create a branch that works on Windows. Right now my windows emacs configuration is a small subset of this.
