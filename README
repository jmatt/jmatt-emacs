## WINDOWS BRANCH

Created by J. Matt Peterson on and around May 15, 2011.

My emacs configuration for Windows / clojure / ruby / python on Windows 7 with Emacs W32 Patched + GNU Emacs 23.1.50.1 

Also works with emacs 24.1.

Works in combination with my fork of emacs-starter-kit

Thanks to everyone who created awesome open source projects for emacs!

TODOs: Create a branch that works on Windows. Right now my windows emacs configuration is a small subset of this.
