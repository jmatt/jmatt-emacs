Created by J. Matt Peterson on and around October 25, 2011

My emacs configuration for aquamacs / clojure / python / ruby on mac osx 10.7

Also works with brew installed emacs 24.0.90.1

Works in combination with my fork of emacs-starter-kit

Thanks to everyone who created awesome open source projects for emacs!

TODOs: A branch exists on Windows but it is out of sync with master. Right now the windows branch only supports a subset of master's functionality.
